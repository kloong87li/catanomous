~~ Notes ~~
To fix hexagon detection issues
  - modify canny and hough circle thresh
  - look at sure_fg during watershed step in hexagon.py

To fix colors
  - look at mean_colors and kmeans in board.py
  - adjust thresholds in tile_color.py or tile.py

to fix deserts
  - adjust circle detection thresh's in tile.py
  - if too many deserts, needs lower thresholds -> more circles
  - if not enough deserts, needs high thresholds -> less circles


~~ TODO ~~
Figure out tesseract stuff


~~~ CV Pipelne ~~~~
- Use thresholding to isolate board (based on water)
- Erode to exaggerate dark lines
- Canny edge detection to get edges of hexagons
- Watershed algorithm to get disjoint components i.e each hexagon
    - use circle detection to augment markers
- findContours to get each hexagon
- Replace each hexagon with its mean color
    - meanShiftFilter
    - replace/amplify red/yellow colors using thresholding
    - compute mean
- compute K-Means to quantize hexagon colors
